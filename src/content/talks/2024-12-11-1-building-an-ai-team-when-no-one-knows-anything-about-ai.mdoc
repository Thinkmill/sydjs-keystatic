We started a brand new AI team with 14 engineers that have never touched AI before! We started madly learning about AI, LLMs, top-k, temperature, ALL THESE NEW WORDS!

After 6 months, we’ve learned so much, we’re productive and it feels like we’re building something special.

I’ll describe how we quickly became productive, tips to give a large team focus, methodical thinking and some examples how we’re really all just problem solvers.

The audience will get a taste of what it’s like to start prompt engineering for the first time, how backwards it feels and how we can do better.
