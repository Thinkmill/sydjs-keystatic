Tiny Talking Todos (or Talkies) is a web-based AI project Joshua is building, available to try at [tinytalkingtodos.com](https://tinytalkingtodos.com)

Talkies is a personal knowledge base with a voice assistant, the “Operator.” You can store and manage knowledge as lists and tasks, from simple to-do lists to complex, contextual tools like temperature trackers or meal planners. The Operator lets you query and perform multi-step transformations without a complex UI. 

There's a growing template library, plus the option to create new templates with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
