SydJS is back! And even better â€” we're bringing friends. Well ... more friends!

While we think we're one of the best meet-ups in Sydney, this month we're having some of our friends over. Friends from other meet-ups!

The organisers of SydCSS and ReactSydney have arranged for some of their community to join us and give us a taste of what they have on offer.

If you haven't had a chance to get to either of those meet-ups, joining us at SydJS this month will give you a great taste of what they offer!

And if you know another meet-up we should invite over, let us know
